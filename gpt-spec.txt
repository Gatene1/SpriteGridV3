Gatene Palette File Format (.gpt)
----------------------------------

Header: "PAL"
  - The first 3 characters must be "PAL"
  - This identifies the file as a valid Gatene Palette file

Format Flag: character at index 3
  - "#" = Legacy format (Hex String)
  - "|" = Modern format (Uint32)

Data Structure:

If format flag is "#":
  - Each color is a 7-character hex string: "#RRGGBB"
  - Alpha is assumed to be 255 (fully opaque) and appended as "FF" during parsing
  - Colors are contiguous: no delimiters beyond the '#' prefix for each block
  - Example: PAL#FF0000#00FF00#0000FF

If format flag is "|":
  - Each color is stored as an unsigned 32-bit integer (0 to 4294967295)
  - Colors are delimited by "|"
  - Example: PAL|4294901760|4278255360|4278190335

Recommended Extension:
  - .gpt (Gatene Palette Technology)

Notes:
  - This file format is custom and designed for SpriteGrid3.
  - Parsers should validate the "PAL" header and format flag before processing data.
  - Future versions may introduce additional format flags or embedded metadata.
