- Moved each window around by its title.
- Changed the titlebar color of each window by clicking its gear icon.
- Minimized each window by clicking its close X icon.
- Able to bring back each window by clicking the icon bearing its name on
  the far left of the screen.
- Coordinated Z-Index property of each window, so when one is clicked, it
  has the highest z-index of them all, and reorders the other windows
  appropriately.

- Finished setting the functionality for the Grid Size and Cell Size range sliders. The sliders themselves are still unable to be dragged, but can still click within the boundaries of the range element to make changes to the grid or cell size ranges.
- Made the Working Grid window wider, and thinned the Color Selection and Preview windows, so the two ranges can be seen from the beginning of working with the Web App, in case they couldn't see them on smaller screens and didn't know they just need to scroll over to get them.
